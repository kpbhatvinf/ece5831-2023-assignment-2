Boogie is a genre of music and dance that originated in the United States in the early 20th century. 
It is characterized by its upbeat and lively tempo, often featuring a syncopated rhythm. 
Boogie music typically incorporates elements of jazz, blues, and swing, and it became especially popular during the swing era of the 1930s and 1940s. 
Boogie dancing involves fast footwork, spins, and energetic movements, often performed to boogie-woogie or rock and roll music. 
It continues to be enjoyed today as both a historical dance style and a vibrant form of entertainment.
